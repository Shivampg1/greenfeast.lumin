GREEN FEAST is a smart system that helps reduce food waste using technology. Here‚Äôs how it works, step by step:

1. üì∏ Photo of the Plate (Thali)
After a person finishes eating, they place their plate in front of a small camera.
The camera takes a photo of the leftover food on the plate.

2. ü§ñ AI Checks Leftover Food
The system uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) to look at the photo and understand:

What kind of food is left

How much food is left

It can recognize rice, chapati, curry, vegetables, etc.

3. ‚öñÔ∏è Estimates Wasted Food (in grams)
The system then calculates the weight of the leftover food.
It does this by:

Analyzing the photo

Using smart calculations (trained with sample data)
This helps to know how much food is wasted by one person.

4. üí∏ Penalty System with UPI
If someone wastes more than a certain limit (for example, 50 grams), the system will automatically:

Charge a small fine (like ‚Çπ5‚Äì‚Çπ10) through UPI

The UPI is linked with the person‚Äôs ID or mess account

This makes people think before wasting food.

5. ‚ù§Ô∏è Charity with Purpose
All the money collected from fines goes to donate meals to poor and hungry people.
So even if someone wastes food, that fine helps someone in need.

üéØ What This Solves
Reduces unnecessary food waste

Teaches people to take only what they can eat

Helps feed the needy with collected fines

Easy to install in mess halls, hostels, and cafeterias
